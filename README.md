# Zip-Extracter
python - extracts contents of zip file with sub directories

Script that automatically copies all files from a zip file with an unknown file name to the same parent directory, then deletes the zip file. Creates a copy of all files and sub folders into a separate directory (so as to not create an error in deleting the same file you're trying to extract from)
